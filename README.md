The Story of Spike ðŸŒµ

Spike was my pet succulent, a proud resident of my windowsill. It was a silent companion, radiating calm and resilience. Like many succulents, Spike needed minimal care, but that didnâ€™t mean it needed no care. Unfortunately, I overlooked this and failed to water Spike for weeks.
One day, I found Spike on the floor below the windowsillâ€”its pot shattered, its leaves broken. Whether it was the wind or a silent act of desperation, Spike had fallen. This heartbreaking moment made me realize that I had failed as a plant parent. To honor Spikeâ€™s memory and prevent other plants from facing a similar fate, I implemented SpikeGuard.

ðŸŒŸ Features

SpikeGuardâ€™s Senses

	1.	Soil Moisture Sensor: Alerts when water levels are too low.
	2.	Temperature Sensor: Tracks if the environment is too hot or too cold.
	3.	Light Sensor (LDR): Detects whether the plant is getting enough sunlight.

SpikeGuardâ€™s Expressions

SpikeGuard communicates your plantâ€™s status through a colorful 2-inch IPS LCD display:
	â€¢	Thirsty: Soil is too dryâ€”water needed.
	â€¢	Hot: Temperature is too highâ€”move to a cooler spot.
	â€¢	Freeze: Temperature is too lowâ€”warm things up.
	â€¢	Sleepy: Not enough lightâ€”find a brighter location.
	â€¢	Savory: After watering, SpikeGuard shows gratitude.
	â€¢	Happy: Perfect conditions mean your plant is thriving!

Hardware Overview

Brain: Raspberry Pi Zero 2W

The Raspberry Pi Zero 2W was chosen for its small size and impressive performance. Powered by a 1GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU with 512MB RAM, itâ€™s perfect for running Python scripts to manage sensors, process data, and display expressions.

Sensors and ADC

	1.	Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor: Durable and corrosion-resistant.
	2.	LM35 Temperature Sensor: Compact and reliable temperature readings.
	3.	Light Sensor (LDR Module): Measures light intensity.
	4.	ADS1115 ADC: A 16-bit analog-to-digital converter bridges analog sensors to the Raspberry Pi.

Display

The 2-inch IPS LCD screen displays six animated plant expressions, enhancing the fun and interactivity of the project.

3D-Printed Case

The SpikeGuard housing is 3D-printed using PLA material and designed with three main components:
	â€¢	Outer Cover
	â€¢	Base
	â€¢	Plant Container

The design avoids screws for ease of assembly. The case holds the sensors, display, and Raspberry Pi securely.
